# The-Comparison-of-Different-Brand-Products-According-to-Specific-Criteria

I did this project for “Probability and Statistics Course”. There were some quality values of different brand products in the excel file. 
I got these values and evaluated according to many specific criteria in R language. Then, I determined general quality degrees of these 
products.
